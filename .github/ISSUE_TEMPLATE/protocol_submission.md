## Protocol Name

## Symbol

Please provide the protocol’s symbol (i.e. LPT)

## Category

Please provide the protocol’s category (i.e. "Work Protocol")

## Subcategory

Please provide the protocol’s subcategory (i.e. "Storage")

## Please provide a description of the protocol. 

## Why do you believe this protocol is a good fit for The Web3 Index?

## Can you describe the protocol's tokenomics?

## Who are the demand and supply side participants in the protocol? Please detail how both participants interact with the protocol.

## Please provide the protocol’s cumulative fees over the past 30- and 90-day periods.

Fees are generally categorized as explicit or implicit.

An example of an explicit fee could be a single payment for work done by the protocol. Examples of this would be a payment to register a domain name with the ENS protocol or a payment to store data on Arweave. 

Please note a user/developer stake in isolation does not count toward explicit fees unless the staked balance reduces as protocol services are rendered. In this case the spent/burned amount of the balance would constitute an explicit fee. 

In certain protocols the user/developer stake does not get spent/burned as work is rendered. In this case the cost to stake is quantified as being equivalent to supply-side dilution and is categorized as an implicit fee.
